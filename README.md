# scryer
> A random generator for interpretive word combinations.

## Getting Started 

Scryer is built purely in javascript and can be run locally on a simple http server - in terminal run:

<code>$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer</code>

Scryer utilizes a library of common terms which are split into an <code>array()</code>. Generating returns a pair of these terms. 

## Why

Scryer is built to invite opportunities for inspiration by introducing an element of chance. Reacting to chance operations can lead to new avenues of thinking. 

Considerations:

* Are the terms related or different? Is the pair better or worse because of it?
* What narrative is occurring between the word pairs? 
* Does the meaning change if terms are flipped?

## History

### The I Ching

John Cage was known to utilize the [I Ching]() when developing his compositions. Commonly used as an ancient form of Chinese divination, Cage saw the I Ching as a tool for composing using chance. He could remove intention from the work and rely on methods of divination to guide his sound. 


### Geomantic Devices

The I Ching isn't the only tool of this sort. Ancient Islamic inventors developed advanced instruments which were used to attain divine knowledge. Various dials could be turned which would result in a series of random patterns that could be interpreted.


### Digital Geomancy
 
Scryer sets out to be a sort of geomantic instrument for inspiration - less divine, more digital. By interpreting the relationship of random variables, we gain a sense of new understanding. This observation of chance operations become a mirror for us to see ourselves.
